# 1D-DNS
1D Direct Numerical Simulation 

This is a C++ Implementation of a Python code written by Edward R.Smith, @ https://www.edwardsmith.co.uk/content/Fluid_Dynamics_On_A_Line.html

The purpose of this work is just for practicising paradigms such as OOP and Parallelisation as opposed to creating a useful CFD Solver.
